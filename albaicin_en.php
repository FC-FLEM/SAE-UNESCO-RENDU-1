                            <p class="description">Formed under the Nasrid dynasty, the Albaicin district is the best-preserved example of a Hispano-Muslim city in Spain. <br>
                In the 11th century, Berber tribal chiefs like the Zirids founded the taifa (Arabic طائفة) of Grenada, which corresponded to a kingdom independent of the surrounding kingdoms. One of the major Zirid constructions brought to the Albaicin was the remodeling of Granada's "Alcazaba Cadima" wall (not to be confused with the Alcazaba of the Alhambra), which is the main reason Grenada was chosen as a defensive city for the kings. <br>
                After the Catholic Reconquista of Spain, the Albaicin remained unchanged as it adapted to a purely Christian way of life.<br>
                UNESCO and the city are working to restore the buildings using appropriate materials to preserve the district's authenticity.</p>

                            <p class="description">The Albaicin residential district, once the cradle of the city of Granada, is a remarkable architectural and urban heritage from the Moorish era, illustrating the essence of a Hispano-Muslim city.<br>
                The medieval town is characterized by its winding streets and squares, lined with modest Andalusian and Moorish-style dwellings. The narrowness of the streets and the height of the houses keep the air cool, even in Andalusia's hot weather.<br>
                Houses are traditionally painted white, a practice that dates back to the Moorish occupation of the region, when white was considered a sacred and purifying color. White also reflects the sun's heat, keeping the inside of houses cool on hot Andalusian summer days. As a result, many villages in Andalusia have adopted this tradition of painting houses white, offering a sense of cleanliness and harmony.

                        <p>The Real Chancillería de Granada is a historic building that has served as the supreme court of justice for the Granada region for several centuries. It was built in 1531 and played a crucial role in consolidating royal power and the administration of justice during the Reconquista period.<br>
                        Today, the Real Chancillería is home to a museum that tells the story of the Granada region and Spain during the medieval period. The museum features collections of documents, objects and paintings relating to the legal and political history of Andalusia, as well as a model of the city of Granada in medieval times.

                        What's more, the mirador de San Nicolas, located in a small square in front of the church, offers a magnificent panoramic view of the Alhambra and the Sierra Nevada, Andalusia's highest mountain range. This view is particularly appreciated at sunset.

                        <p>El Paseo de los Tristes is Granada's best-known street, facing the Alhambra and providing easy access to the Sacromonte district. The path is nicknamed "triste" because it was the route used for funeral processions. This street links the district to the Alhambra hill via a series of bridges, including Puente de las Chirimías. Its location, with its breathtaking view of the Alhambra, helps maintain the romantic image of the Darro, which runs through Granada.</p>

                        <p>Sacromonte is an ancient gypsy town located on Mount Valparaíso. Cuesta del Chapiz is one of the Albaicin's most emblematic streets.<br>
                        This street, with its steep slope, rises from the Paseo de Los Tristes to the parish church of El Salvador. To the left of the street are the gypsy caves, glistening with lime and covered with agaves and nopales.<br>
                        In the past, these caves were home to festivals where zambras were held, which were gypsy celebrations that often included traditional songs and music, including flamenco.</p>
