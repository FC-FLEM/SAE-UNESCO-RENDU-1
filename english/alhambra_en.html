                <p>It is within the very last Muslim bastion, in the kingdom of Granada, that many artists and talents took refuge. They fled the Catholic reconquest of the Iberian Peninsula. It is this gathering of knowledge and talent that will give rise to extraordinary results in the heart of the kingdom such as the magnificent Alhambra. 
                The Alhambra is a palace perched on top of a plateau, on the hill of Sabika, is in fact a set of palaces, typical organization of the Arab world including many buildings.
                <br>   
                Throughout the period of domination, the Moors brought their art of living, mainly developed around water. It is found a lot in Andalusia but more precisely in Granada. It is in this place that the element of water is the most mastered: a perfect technique that makes it serve the beauty and the senses. In addition to the majestic gardens, it creates a kind of eternal spring.
                <br>  
                The main room in which the Sultan receives his guests, has a ceiling of nearly 18m high magnified by the representation of the 7 heavens of Islam carved in wood. The walls of the throne room are decorated with ceramic mosaics assembled piece by piece. They constitute a real game of geometric patterns intertwined. We must not forget the stucco, finely chiseled, present on all the walls of the palace, resplendent with color and gold.
                <br>
                It was in the 14th century that the Alhambra was embellished with decorations with multiple Muslim symbols, especially by Yusuf I. The justice of Granada was administered in the Puerta de la Ley Islámica, which makes the Alhambra more than just a defensive or decorative building. Its defensive architecture makes it a fortress (ramparts, fortified doors, guard towers) with an oriental aesthetic that was used by the Empires who resided in the Generalife, located in the Alhambra.
                <br>
                It is noticeable that the last buildings have many round arches and domed roofs, in order to let in the most light, an important theme in Muslim architecture.
                <br>   
                Granada corresponds to the historical model of a city-hill, surrounded by mountains and watered by the rivers Darro and Genil. Surrounded by mountains, Arab writers have compared Granada to a crown, on the front of which stands the <i>"diadem of the Alhambra"</i>.

            <img class="histoire-image" src="./img/Grenade/Alcazaba.jpg" alt="">
            <div class="histoire-details fadeIn-bottom">
                <p>The Alcazaba is considered the oldest part of the Alhambra. Indeed, it is at the beginning of the <b>IXth</b> century, that constructions are reported on the hill of the Sabika. It is, thereafter, in this precise place, that the majestic Alhambra takes place.
                    <br>
                Rebuilt many times, the Alcazaba of the Albaicín, became in <b>1238</b> the Alhambra Palace that we know today. It was the founder of the Nasrid dynasty, Al Ahmar, who undertook its last reconstruction with the aim of installing the headquarters of the court. Thus, the Alhambra was a palace, a citadel and a fortress, but above all, a residence of the Nasrid high officials.
                <br>
                At the end of the Great War in Spain, the majestic Alhambra became the Royal House.  
                Moreover, in <b>1526</b>, the emperor Charles V decided to build a palace bearing his name and other significant constructions in the style of the Roman Renaissance.
                <br>
                During the Napoleonic occupation of Spain in <b>1812</b>, the Alhambra suffered a huge explosion that almost totally destroyed it. Later, in the <b>nineteenth</b> century, the Alhambra was detached from the Crown and became, in <b>1870</b>, a "national monument".

                        <h4><b>Myrtle Court</b></h4>
                    <p>The current name of this place is the Courtyard of the Myrtles because of the presence of myrtle bushes around the central pond and the bright green color that contrasts with the white marble floor of the patio. 
                        It is a long courtyard that surrounds the Alberca pond. At that time, the rooms on the sides were used as a residence for women. In addition, in the north gallery, we can read a famous poem by Ibn Zamrak in honor of Muhammad V after the conquest of Algeciras in 1368.

                    <p>The courtyard of the Lions is probably the most famous place of the Alhambra. The fountain in the middle of the patio gave its name to the whole. 
                        Indeed, it is composed of twelve lions jets of water and rests on a large dodecagonal basin in white marble. This fountain is considered one of the most important examples of Muslim sculpture. 
                        The Gallery of the Court of Lions is a covered space supported by a hundred white marble columns. Since 1984, it has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
