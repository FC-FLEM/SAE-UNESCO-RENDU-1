        <div class="Histoire">
            <img class="histoire" src="./img/Grenade/Night_view_Alhambra.jpg" float="left">
            <p>
                The Alhambra takes place on the Sabika hill during the <b>IXth</b> century. He is a former prime
                minister named Samuel ibn Nagrella who rebuilt the abandoned buildings on this hill and installed his
                palace there. and installed his palace there.
            </p>
            <p>In the <b>XIIth</b> century, These buildings are used as a refuge during fights in Alcazaba del Albaicín.
            </p>
            <p>In <b>1238</b>, the founder of the Nasrid dynasty, Al-Ahmar, settled in the old Alcazaba of the Albaicín.
                He decided to rebuild the ruins of the hill, thus building the current Alhambra. It was a palace, a
                citadel
                and a fortress, but above all, a residence of the Nasrid high officials. Granada became the capital of
                the Nasrid kingdom, growing over time to make room for new neighborhoods until the end of the fifteenth
                century.
            </p>
            <p>After <b>1492</b>, the Alhambra became a Royal House.
            </p>
            <p>Emperor Charles V decides, in <b>1526</b>, to build his eponymous palace, as well as other
                buildings having for style the Roman Renaissance.
            </p>
            <p>In the <b>XIXth</b> century, the company is very interested in the gardens of the Alhambra. Following the
                revolution
                of 1868, the Alhambra is detached from the Crown and becomes the domain of the State, being declared in
                1870 "national monument". <br>Currently, the custody of the Alhambra is entrusted to the Autonomous
                Community
                Andalusia of the functions and services of the State in the field of culture.</p>

        <h3>Arts & Architectures</h3>
        <div class="ART">
            <img class="arte" src="./img/Grenade/Arquitectura_Alhambra.jpg" float="left">
            <p>It was in the 14th century that the Alhambra was embellished with decorations with multiple Muslim
                symbols, notably by Yusuf I. The justice of Granada was administered in the Puerta de la Ley Islamica,
                which makes the Alhambra more than just a defensive or decorative building. Its defensive architecture
                makes the Alhambra a fortress (ramparts, fortified gates, guard towers) with an "oriental" aesthetic
                that was used by the Emirs who resided in the Generalife, located in the Alhamlbra. <br>It is noticeable
                that the last buildings have many round arches and domed roofs, to let in as much light as possible, an
                important theme in Muslim architecture.</p>
            <p>Granada corresponds to the historical model of a city-hill, surrounded by mountains and watered by the
                rivers Darro and Genil.
                Surrounded by mountains, Arab writers have compared Granada to a crown, on the front of which stands the
                <i>"diadem of the Alhambra".</i>

                        was originally a fortress designed to protect the city of Granada from enemy invasions. It was
                        completed by Muhammad I who also built the Keep and the Torre de Vela..</p>
                    <p>The building is divided into two parts: the upper part, called the citadel, was used as a
